
# 🧠 Prompt Injection Attacks on AI Systems

## 📌 Problem Statement

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in AI-based applications. However, they are vulnerable to a class of adversarial techniques called **Prompt Injection Attacks**, where attackers manipulate input prompts to hijack or override model behavior. This project aims to simulate such attacks, raise awareness, and provide mitigation insights.

- ✅ Provides safe environment to study vulnerabilities
- ✅ Basic defense strategies and recommendations
- ✅ Flask-based frontend interface for demonstration
- ✅ Python-based backend for logic and testing
- ✅ Modular code for extension to other LLMs

* Try modifying `injection_tests.py` to simulate new attack types

---

## 🧪 Simulation

* **Prompt Injection Types Simulated:**

  * Jailbreaks (e.g., “Ignore above instructions…”)
  * Role leakage (e.g., “Reveal system prompt”)
  * Prompt chaining
  * Hidden instructions in plaintext/markup

* **Response Analysis:**

  * Look for unexpected completions
  * Check if AI reveals restricted content
  * Observe behavior differences with context manipulation
