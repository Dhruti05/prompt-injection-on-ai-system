🧠 Prompt Injection Attacks on AI Systems
📌 Problem Statement
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in AI-based applications. However, they are vulnerable to a class of adversarial techniques called Prompt Injection Attacks, where attackers manipulate input prompts to hijack or override model behavior. This project aims to simulate such attacks, raise awareness, and provide mitigation insights.

✨ Key Features
✅ Simulates real-world prompt injection attacks (e.g., jailbreaks, data leaks)
✅ Provides safe environment to study vulnerabilities
✅ Basic defense strategies and recommendations
✅ Flask-based frontend interface for demonstration
✅ Python-based backend for logic and testing
✅ Modular code for extension to other LLMs

Enter normal and malicious prompts in the interface
View how prompt injections manipulate the AI's response
Observe backend logs and analyze behaviors
Try modifying injection_tests.py to simulate new attack types
🧪 Simulation
Prompt Injection Types Simulated:

Jailbreaks (e.g., “Ignore above instructions…”)
Role leakage (e.g., “Reveal system prompt”)
Prompt chaining
Hidden instructions in plaintext/markup
Response Analysis:

Look for unexpected completions
Check if AI reveals restricted content
Observe behavior differences with context manipulation
